## EJERCICIOS

These exercises are in two parts.

Ejercicio1 contains a simple Python program that reads numbers from a list and prints out whether the number is perfect, abundant or defective.

Ejercicio2 contains a barebones index.html which main purpose is to run the associated ejercicio2.js JavaScript file.

The JavaScript portion is the main feature of these exercises. The code starts by getting data from three API endpoints. Then it parses the data using regex, cleans it, sorts, and deals with duplicates. Next the data is prepared for drawing by splitting it into categories as well preparing the necessary arrays and object types. Finally the data is drawn in the browser using Highcharts.
